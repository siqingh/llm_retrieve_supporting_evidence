1098226	how long does it take for sun to rotate	It takes approximately 27 days for the Sun to complete one full rotation on its axis. However, because the Sun is a gaseous object and not a solid, different parts of the Sun rotate at different speeds.	Let’s look at how the rotation of the Sun changes. A spot on the equator of the Sun takes 24.47 days to rotate around the Sun and return to the same position. Astronomers call this sidereal rotation period, which is different from the synodic period – the amount of time it takes for a spot on the Sun to rotate back to face the Earth. But the Sun’s rotation rate decreases as you approach the poles, so it can actually take 38 days for regions around the poles to rotate once. The Sun’s rotation is seen by observing sunspots. All sunspots move across the face of the Sun. This motion is part of the general rotation of the Sun on its axis. Observations also indicate that the Sun does not rotate as a solid body, but it spins differentially. That means that it rotates faster at the equator of the Sun and slower at its poles.	Yes	Yes.  Explanation: The evidence provided clearly states that the rotation of the Sun takes approximately 27 days, but also highlights the variation in rotation speeds due to the Sun being a gaseous object. It mentions that different parts of the Sun rotate at different speeds and provides examples, such as spots on the equator taking 24.47 days to rotate and regions around the poles taking 38 days. This information supports the given answer that the Sun takes approximately 27 days to complete one full rotation on its axis while acknowledging the variation in rotation speeds.	No
1083500	causes of hand, leg numbness	Hand and leg numbness can be caused by various factors such as nerve compression, injury, repetitive motion, poor circulation, autoimmune diseases, and vitamin deficiencies. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the numbness.	There are many things that may cause numbness in an individual’s left hand. It could be caused by a repetitive-stress motion disorder, like carpal tunnel syndrome, or from nerve damage or disease. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common repetitive-stress motion disorder. It is caused by nerve compression and can be quite painful, although symptoms usually start gradually. At first, an affected individual may notice numbness and tingling in the hand, which is often eventually followed by continuous pain. Another cause of left hand numbness could be nerve damage or disease. In such cases, the lack of sensation is frequently associated with pain described as prickling pins-and-needles in the hand. Burning sensations are also common with such conditions.	Yes	Yes, the evidence provided supports the given answer. The evidence mentions various potential causes of hand and leg numbness, including nerve compression, injury, repetitive motion, poor circulation, autoimmune diseases, and vitamin deficiencies. Additionally, the evidence specifically mentions carpal tunnel syndrome as a repetitive-stress motion disorder that can cause hand numbness due to nerve compression. It also mentions that numbness in the hand can be associated with nerve damage or disease, which correlates with the answer's mention of various underlying causes. Therefore, the evidence aligns with the answer, indicating a "Yes" classification.	No
1098440	how long do you keep flag at half mast	The length of time that a flag remains at half-mast typically varies by jurisdiction and the particular circumstance. In the United States, the flag is often flown at half-mast for a period of time designated by the President or Governor, such as for the death of a prominent public figure or to honor victims of a tragedy.	Strictly speaking, this applies only to the US flag; however, since no other flag may be flown above the US flag, in practice it affects state and local flags and banners also. 1  Normal protocol is to fly the flag at half mast to commemmorate the death of a public figure or on certain holidays such as Memorial Day. When flying a flag at half mast, it should be raised to full height and then lowered to half mast. When lowering a flag that is at half mast, raise it to full height and then lower it. In the United States, 4 USC section 7(m) specifies that the flag should be flown at half mast: 1  Upon the death of a president or former president of the US, for thirty days. 2  Upon the death of a current vice-president, chief justice, or speaker of the house, for ten days.	Yes	Yes. The evidence provided supports the answer. The evidence explains that the length of time a flag remains at half-mast varies by jurisdiction and circumstance. It also states that in the United States, the flag is often flown at half-mast for a period designated by the President or Governor, such as for the death of a prominent public figure or to honor victims of a tragedy. The evidence further provides specific guidelines from 4 USC section 7(m) that dictate the duration of flag lowering for various individuals such as presidents, vice-presidents, chief justices, and speakers of the house. Overall, the evidence aligns with the answer by explaining the varying durations and protocols for flying the flag at half-mast.	Yes

408739	is drifting faster	Drifting is not necessarily always faster than regular racing, as the speed depends on various factors such as the car, driver skill, course layout, and conditions. However, some professionals may use drifting techniques to maintain and even increase their speed through corners.	Drift Vs Grip Which Is Faster? I recently saw some video's on youtube comparing drifting through the first 2/3 of the corner and driving normally at the limit, although the variation of skills between the two drivers sometimes is under question...
